abstract: In this paper, the resilient time-varying formation control for second-order discrete-time multi-agent systems (DMASs) under communication link attacks and actuator faults is investigated. The number or proportion of edge attacks around each agent, including deception attacks and denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, is bounded. A discrete-time distributed formation protocol based on trim of extreme values and fault estimation and compensation is given. Using robust graph properties and discrete stability theory, sufficient conditions for the given DMASs to realize the desired formation with bounded error are derived. Numerical simulation examples are applied to illustrate the effectiveness of the resilient formation strategy.
